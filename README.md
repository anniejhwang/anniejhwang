My experience in therapeutic recreation has taught me the importance of creating inclusive and user-friendly experiences, while my background in hospitality has honed my communication and problem-solving abilities. As a junior software engineer, I'm eager to leverage my technical skills and my understanding of user needs to develop innovative solutions that enhance the quality of life for individuals and make a positive impact in the digital realm. I'm excited to contribute my creativity, adaptability, and dedication to collaborative software development projects.

A bit more about me...

I'm a Korean American, based in Philadelphia. I have two adorable kitties, a passion for plants, and love spontaneous experiences. Although I love spontaneity, I am most definitely a homebody, and thrive best in comfortable silence :).


Keep up with me!...
