# 🌱 Hi, my name is Annie! 🌱

I am a Korean American born and raised in Philadelphia, learning fullstack web development. I have two adorable kitties, a passion for plants, and love spontaneous experiences. Although I love spontaneity, I am most definitely a homebody, and thrive best in comfortable silence :).
